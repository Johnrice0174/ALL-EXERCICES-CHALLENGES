			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="color: purple;">What made you decide to learn to code?</td>
				<td style="color: blue;">I have failed my first year in Computer Science because of the hebrew language, so i was searching french studies in Israel and i have found Developpers Institute, it is in English but I hope i will succeed. Informatic is not my passion, i am not crazy about, but it is interesting because I am GAMER so i use sometimes some code to modify effects, characters on few different games...</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="color: purple;">Tell us about something funny or interesting you learned about life in Israel.</td>
				<td style="color: blue;">Israel is really extraordinary gorgeous magnificent and pleasant but Israeli People LESS ! xD In fact the Israelies are... specials. I am French, i have an education, values, courtesy, general knowledge, culture... In the love domain too, i am romantic and they are tactless, violents... But be careful! I didn't say ALL the Israelies are bad people or have bad behavior, but most of them yes!

				Of course There also many Israelies (mostly in Religious people) with good education, courtesy, good behavior... i have also noted few good things in Israel that doesn't exist in France, the Fraternity-Solidarity in almost all circumstances...

				So I Love Israel, but less the israeli people but i respect all people and i am a pacifist-humanist sionist so if can give/bring peace between all people i will be happy :)
